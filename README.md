# python-challenge

Within both the PyBank and PyPoll folders, there is a resource folder with the csv that each respective python script will run on. Each folder also has a 'main.py' file with the python code for this task. These scripts will be used to analyze the large datasets and return information in 2 ways, one as printed out in the terminal and additionally in the analysis.txt file within the 'analysis' folders in each greater folder.

## Instructions

For PyBank, the script created in the 'main.py' file will analyze the financial records in the 'budget_data.csv' file to give the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The results should align with these: 

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

For PyPoll, the task is regarding an election and the amount of votes each candidate received alongside detailing who the winning candidate is. Running the script in the 'main.py' file within the PyPoll folder will provide the following: 

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote

This should match:
